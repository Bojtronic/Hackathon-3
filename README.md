# 🌍 GLOBAL AI HACKATHON #3 – Project README

## 🧠 About the Event

**GLOBAL AI HACKATHON – Third Edition**
In collaboration with **MIT Sloan AI Club** & **MIT CNC**
🗓 **November 8–9, 2025**
⏱ **24-hour hackathon weekend**

The **Global AI Hackathon** is an international event bringing together developers, data scientists, designers, and innovators to build impactful solutions powered by artificial intelligence. Participants collaborate intensively for 24 hours to create prototypes, research concepts, or working demos that address real-world challenges through machine learning, deep learning, and emerging AI technologies.

## 🏋️ Challenge: Win the Next Olympics – Build an AI Video Coach for Elite Athletes

**Track:** VC Big Bets
**Focus Area:** *Injury and Risk Detection*

### 🎯 Project Focus

This project aims to develop an **AI system for injury and risk detection** in elite sports through video-based motion analysis.

Using **computer vision** and **pose estimation models**, the system identifies unsafe movements, unstable landings, or fatigue patterns that could lead to injury. By analyzing motion dynamics and biomechanical stress, it provides **early warnings and preventive insights** for athletes and coaches.

While the challenge emphasizes gymnastics due to its technical complexity, the same principles can apply to other sports such as diving, figure skating, martial arts, or athletics — wherever movement precision and body control are essential.

### 💡 Why It Matters

In elite competition, small errors can have major consequences.
AI can offer **objective, real-time feedback** that traditional coaching cannot — enabling safer, smarter, and more effective training.

By detecting risk factors early, this project contributes to:

- Preventing sports-related injuries
- Extending athlete careers
- Supporting data-driven training decisions
- Enhancing performance and safety in high-level sports
